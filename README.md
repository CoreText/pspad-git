# pspad-git
local and remote Git commands for PsPad editor

Copy the gitCommands.vbs file into the Script\VBScript directory

Prerequisites: 
It is supposed that GIT is already installed and available 
in the path environment variable, accessible from everywhere

The first thing you should do when you install Git is 
to set your user name and email address. 

This is important because every Git commit uses this information, 
   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
   git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

This will be stored in the local file .git\config file
[user] 
   user.name=John Doe
   user.email=johndoe@example.com
